1.Configure AppSetting


Instead of relying on hardcoded configurations, we can use a strongly-typed approach, allowing us to benefit from the properties' type safety.

1. Create AppSetting Model

2. Configure AppSetting in Program.cs as { builder.Services.Configure<ApiSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ApiSettings")); }

3. Inject the ApiSetting configuration in the constrructor as { constructor(IOptions<ApiSettings> apiSettings)}
